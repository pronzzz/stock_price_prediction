Tata Global Stock Price Prediction using KNN Implementation
Stock/ Dataset Source: Quandl
Main Targets:
1. Regression Problem: To predict the Close Target.
2. Classification Problem: To predict whether to BUY or SELL the stock.
   BUY:+1
   SELL:-1
(Approach point) K using GridsearchCV

﻿This code is a comprehensive demonstration of K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for machine learning tasks. It includes both classification and regression problems, making it a valuable resource for individuals interested in exploring the capabilities of KNN.

The code begins by importing essential libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Quandl. It then fetches real-world stock data fromQuandl and performs data preprocessing before splitting the data into training and testing sets.

For the classification task, the code extracts features and prepares the target variable, which indicates whether to buy or sell a stock. It applies K-Nearest Neighbors classifier with grid search cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters and evaluates its performance on both training and test data.

In the regression task, the code predicts the closing stock prices using K-Nearest Neighbor regression. Similar to the classification problem, grid search cross-validation is employed to find the optimal hyperparameters. The code calculates the root mean squared error (RMSE) as a metric to assess the model's performance.

Finally, the code presents the actual and predicted values for both classification and regression tasks, providing a clear demonstration of KNN algorithm's application in real-world scenarios.﻿
